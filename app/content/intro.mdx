Frontend developer based in Porto, currently working at [Immera](https://immera.io/).

I have used a plethora of technologies for different challenges such as **Vue / Nuxt.js** and **React / Next.js**.

My contributions range from building interactive solutions to [service support tools equipped with augmented reality and knowledge management to support critical operations](https://brightnow.app/).

I hold a Bachelor's in [Communication and Multimedia](https://www.utad.pt/estudar/en/cursos/communication-and-multimedia/) from UTAD and completed the postgraduate coursework of the [Master's in Informatics Engineering](https://www.ipp.pt/education/courses/master/isep/954) at ISEP.

Outside of work, I'm passionate about _game development_, _3D modeling_ and sharing knowledge through **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@elcascavel)**, where my content has reached over 500k views.

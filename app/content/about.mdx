I'm **Simão** — a frontend developer based in Porto, Portugal. I build modern web apps using **Vue/Nuxt**, **React/Next**, and CMS platforms with **Payload CMS** and **Vendure**.

Some of my more notable projects include building **AR-powered service tools**, and currently, a **mafia-themed** videogame in Godot.

Most of my work focuses on **frontend** web development. I also run several channels like **[Cascavel](https://www.youtube.com/@elcascavel)** and [Members Only](https://www.youtube.com/@membersonlymods) with over **500k views**, where I share content on **game dev**, **3D modeling**, and modding.

Outside of software, I enjoy **game development** **3D art** and content creation!

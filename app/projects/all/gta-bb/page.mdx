# Context

Grand Theft Auto: Blue & Blood was a story mod project built for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, aiming to go deeper into the rabbit hole of C.R.A.S.H.'s endeavors in a new, independent narrative while staying faithful to the canonic events of the 3D era.

## Story
The year is 1990, in Los Santos, San Andreas and Joshua Brice is the new face in C.R.A.S.H. - the LSPD's notorious anti-gang unit.

The city's underworld is being shaken to its core, ravaged by the ongoing crack epidemic and a deadly new drug called SPANK. As SPANK's first batches flood the streets, its devastating side effects claim lives, igniting public outcry and mounting pressure on C.R.A.S.H. to take action. While the Ballas and Vagos grow stronger, the Grove Street Families and Aztecas refuse to let SPANK poison their turf.

Under the wing of his new partner, Detective Vaughn, Brice will learn what his badge really means. In Los Santos, everyone has a price.

## Development
The mod was being developed with [CLEO Redux](https://re.cleo.li/). Along with other two collaborators, I wrote most of the story skeleton and created a [lot of the models seen in the mod](https://cascavel.itch.io/blue-blood-assets), including the new player character. I also wrote features and missions with CLEO Redux, allowing us to use Javascript.

## Reception
The mod was well-received in the community, with many praising the dialogue and comparing it to many popular works such as Training Day, The Wire and even calling it an "unofficial DLC" to Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.

*Videos of the mod have amassed over 280k views on YouTube, with the introduction alone having over 200k views!*

## Status
The project was cancelled after the team decided to focus efforts on creating an original independent project rather than continuing development as a mod.
